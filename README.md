# Balatro-Mods
Just a collection of mods made by me to enhance the experiences when playing Balatro (YOU CAN WIN EASILY!)

--How to Download & Apply Mods
!!Use Steammodded!!

1. Open the mods folder
2. Download the release
3. Extract the file (it should contain one folder with inside it a folder named assets, a json file, and a lua file)
4. Open your %appdata%/Balatro folder
5. Put the folder inside the Mods folder (Create one if you don't have it)
6. Enjoy!!
